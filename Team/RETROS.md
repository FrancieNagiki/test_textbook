## RECAP (START/STOP/GO)

* START: I think we should start trying to get the web app working and figure out how we should distribute the work effectively.
* STOP: I think we should stop leaving decisions about the web app for later.
* GO: I think we should continue learning from tutorials and keeping a positive mindset.
 
## Action item

* a goal: Learn JavaScript and get a placeholder web app.
* a change: Contact each other more often on slack to keep everyone up to date.
