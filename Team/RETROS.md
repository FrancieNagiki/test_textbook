## RECAP (START/STOP/GO)

* START: I think we should start trying to get the web app working and figure out how we should distribute the work effectively.
* STOP: I think we should stop leaving decisions about the web app for later.
* GO: I think we should continue learning from tutorials and keeping a positive mindset.
 
## Action item

* a goal: Learn JavaScript and get a placeholder web app.
* a change: Contact each other more often on slack to keep everyone up to date.
* a measurement: See if we can develop a basic web app that functions properly.

## Retro Assessment 

* We used the start/stop/continue retro style where we all put our ideas in the slack and dicussed them once everyone shared. 
* The retro went well for situation we had. Retro leaders had to switched on the spot, but regardless we got many great ideas through our discussion. We clarrified what we need to do in the future to be successful. 
* The advice I would give to the next retro leader is come in with a game plan on what needs to be discussed so there is no wasted time.
